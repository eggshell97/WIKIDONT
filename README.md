# WIKIDONT
Client-side tool for bypassing the occasional Wikidot issue.

This acts as a chrome extension, and is in an unpacked format so you can check and modify the code. If you don't know how to use an unpacked chrome extension, read the steps below.

1. Download and unzip the files. There should be an images folder with 3 poorly-drawn images, a manifest file, and a content file.
2. Type "chrome://extensions/" into your URL bar. You probably need to use chrome, unless you have a way to get around that.
3. Click on "Developer mode" in the top right of the page, then click "Load unpacked" and select the folder you placed the unpacked files in.
4. Turn the extension on.
5. You can now bypass Wikidot issues! That is, only the ones I have encountered and found client-side bypasses for.

The button for WIKIDONT will appear only on Wikidot, and it will appear in the top-left corner by default.
Currently, WIKIDONT is capable of the following:

1. Bypassing "Fatal error: Function name must be a string in /wikidot/app/releases/962533faf5b3667841198082c99c744e579f6796/web/router.php on line 52": Click the WIKIDONT button and type where ON THAT SUBDOMAIN you want to go. If you are already on the page you want to be, but the error appears, simply delete the "/" in the text box and press enter. You will be sent to the page you are currently on, but it will be fixed.
